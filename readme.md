## 📥 Installation

### 📦 Step 1: Go to Releases Page

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/your-username/go-markdown-render/releases)
2. Download the latest release for your operating system

### 🧩 Step 2: Download the correct binary

Download the appropriate file for your system:

| OS      | Architecture | File                       |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Windows | amd64        | `showmd_windows_amd64.exe` |
| Linux   | arm64        | `showmd_linux_arm64`       |
| macOS   | arm64        | `showmd_darwin_arm64`      |

---

### 🧱 Step 3: Rename the binary

Rename the downloaded file to just **`showmd`** for consistency.

#### Windows:

```powershell
rename showmd_windows_amd64.exe showmd.exe
```

#### Linux / macOS:

```bash
mv showmd_linux_arm64 showmd
# or
mv showmd_darwin_arm64 showmd
```

---

### ⚙️ Step 4: Make it executable (Linux / macOS only)

```bash
chmod +x showmd
```

---

### 🌍 Step 5: Move it to a system PATH directory

#### **Windows:**

1. Move `showmd.exe` to a permanent location, e.g.
   `C:\Program Files\showmd\`
2. Add that folder to your system PATH:

   - Press **Win + S**, search **Environment Variables**
   - Click **Edit the system environment variables**
   - Click **Environment Variables…**
   - Under **System variables**, select **Path → Edit → New**
   - Add the path:

     ```
     C:\Program Files\showmd
     ```

   - Click **OK** to save everything.

#### **Linux / macOS:**

Move `showmd` to `/usr/local/bin` (or any PATH directory):

```bash
sudo mv showmd /usr/local/bin/
```

---

### ✅ Step 6: Verify installation

Run:

```bash
showmd --version
```

If it prints version info or help text, it's installed correctly.
